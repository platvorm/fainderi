# fainderi

## Inspiration
Every year thousands of people get lost and buried under buildings because of earthquakes. What if there was a easy and cheap way to find those victims in time? 
A 10€ BLE sticker and any smartphone can do it. 

## What it does
Uses smartphone app to search for BLE-based cheap, 10€ stickers sewn into one thing every person wears - their shirts. 

## How I built it
We used Evothings to have a prototype up and running in 48 hours. 

## Challenges I ran into
Battery life of BLE-equipment - 2 years. Wireless charging in the future? One charger for every village in poorer regions?

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Good distance measuring even in bad reception conditions

## What I learned

## What's next for Fainderi
